**An unofficial command line utility for accessing the [Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph), written with Deno and Typescript**

## Installation

### Before You Get Started

Ensure Deno 1.5.4 installed. If you don't have Deno installed yet, follow the [Deno installation guide](https://deno.land/manual@v1.5.4/getting_started/installation).

This CLI _should_ work on Mac OS, Linux, and Windows operating systems. However, it has only been tested on macOS Catalina v.10.15.7. If you run into any problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nakleiderer/microsoft-graph-cli/issues/new).

### Use Deno Install (Preferred)

If you'd like to install this project as an executable in your path, run:

`deno install --unstable [permissions] -n mgraph https://deno.land/x/microsoft_graph_cli@v0.0.0-development/cli.ts`

- Replace `[permissions]` in this command with any permissions you wish to grant to the CLI. See [Permissions](#Permissions) for all optional and required permissions and their rationale. Example: `--allow-net --allow-read --allow-write`
- (Optional) If you would like to grant all permissions to this CLI, you may replace `[permissions]` with `--allow-all`. This will prevent errors if future versions require new permissions, but is considered less secure.
- (Optional) You may install this cli with a different executable name by replace `mgraph` with a name of your choice. If you do so, make sure to replace `mgraph` with your selected name in all usage examples.
- (Optional) You may install any [released version](https://github.com/nakleiderer/microsoft-graph-cli/releases) of this CLI by changing `v0.0.0-development` to the desired version.

### Use Deno Run

If you don't wish to [use deno install](#use-deno-install-preferred), replace any instances of `mgraph` in the usage examples with:

`deno run --unstable [permissions] https://deno.land/x/microsoft_graph_cli@v0.0.0-development/cli.ts`

- Replace `[permissions]` in this command with any permissions you wish to grant to the CLI. See [Permissions](#Permissions) for all optional and required permissions and their rationale. Example: `--allow-net --allow-read --allow-write`
- (Optional) If you would like to grant all permissions to this CLI, you may replace `[permissions]` with `--allow-all`. This will prevent errors if future versions require new permissions, but is considered less secure.
- (Optional) You may use any [released version](https://github.com/nakleiderer/microsoft-graph-cli/releases) of this CLI by changing the `v0.0.0-development` to the desired version.

### Updating

If you've previously installed with [deno install](#use-deno-install-preferred), you may update by adding the `-f` flag to the command:

`deno install --unstable [permissions] -n mgraph -f https://deno.land/x/microsoft_graph_cli@v0.0.0-development/cli.ts`

- Replace `[permissions]` in this command with any permissions you wish to grant to the CLI. See [Permissions](#Permissions) for all optional and required permissions and their rationale. Example: `--allow-net --allow-read --allow-write`
- (Optional) If you would like to grant all permissions to this CLI, you may replace `[permissions]` with `--allow-all`. This will prevent errors if future versions require new permissions, but is considered less secure.
- (Optional) You may install this cli with a different executable name by replace `mgraph` with a name of your choice. If you do so, make sure to replace `mgraph` with your selected name in all usage examples.
- (Optional) You may install any [released version](https://github.com/nakleiderer/microsoft-graph-cli/releases) of this CLI by changing the `v0.0.0-development` to the desired version.

If you use the [deno run](#use-deno-install-preferred) installation option, simply change the `v0.0.0-development` to the [latest release](https://github.com/nakleiderer/microsoft-graph-cli/releases/latest) when you next run the program.

## Usage

Run `mgraph --help` for a full list of all commands and parameters.
